\Section{Design and Implementation}
\label{sec:designimplementation}

This chapter discusses the design and implementation of the open-source tool to extract relations. It includes the architectural design, extraction rules and issues encountered during development.

\subsection{Corpus}
\label{sec:corpus}

The input corpus for this study is comprised of 30 children's stories. Each were encoded digitally and modified to remove dialogues. The raw version was retained and used with the modified stories. For this research, the 2 corpus are named \emph{RAW} and \emph{MODIFIED}. Overall, 60 stories were used to extract the relations. Shown in Table \ref{tab:stories} are the different story groups and their corresponding age groups. 

\begin{table}[ht]   %t means place on top, replace with b if you want to place at the bottom

\caption{Children's Story Groups} \vspace{0.25em}
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|} \hline
Group Name & No. of Stories & Age Group \\ \hline
Topsy Tim					& 5 & 4-7 y.o. \\ \hline
Little Life Lessons			& 16 & 4-7 y.o. \\ \hline
Jumpstart					& 7 & 8-10 y.o. \\ \hline
Winnie the Pooh				& 2 & 8-10 y.o. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:stories}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Modifications}
\label{sec:modifications}

As mentioned, each children's story in the corpus underwent different types of modifications to clean the data of any inconsistencies. And in order to illustrate the different modifications, here is an unmodified excerpt from one of the stories already in the corpus entitled ``A Wild Weather Day".

\begin{verse}
\itshape
It was a wild and windy day. The JumpStart ship was headed for Tree Fort Island. \\
Frankie was at the wheel. The sails flapped in the wind. The ship raced through the water. \\
``Why are we going so fast?" Pierre asked. ``The wind is blowing us along on our adventure," CJ said. ``Did you know that wind is just air that is strong and fast?" \\
``Like Frankie!" Pierre said. ``He's strong and fast, too." \\
``Why is the sky getting so dark?" Pierre asked. \\
``I know why it's dark!" Eleanor said. ``Clouds get dark when they fill up with tiny drops of water." \\
``Look! They're almost the same color as your bow," Pierre said. \\
A big drop of rain fell on Pierre's nose. ``Oh, no!" he said. ``It's starting to rain!" \\
``The rain is coming from the clouds," CJ said. \\
``The water in tne clouds got too heavy, and now it's falling down on us!" \\
``Just like when Hopsalot waters his garden," said Pierre. \\
\end{verse}

The first type of modification is done by transforming the dialogues into declarative sentences. Here is the modified version of the excerpt above:

\begin{verse}
\itshape
It was a wild and windy day. The JumpStart ship was headed for Tree Fort Island. \\
Frankie was at the wheel. The sails flapped in the wind. The ship raced through the water. \\
They are going so fast. The wind is blowing them along on their adventure. The wind is just air that is strong and fast. \\
Frankie is like the wind. He's strong and fast, too. \\
The sky is getting so dark.\\
Eleanor knows why it is dark. Clouds get dark when they fill up with tiny drops of water. \\
They are almost the same color as Eleanor's bow. \\
A big drop of rain fell on Pierre's nose. It is starting to rain! \\
The rain is coming from the clouds. \\
The water in the clouds got too heavy, and now it is falling down on them! \\
Just like when Hopsalot waters his garden. \\
\end{verse}

The second type is the usual transformation of direct to indirect speech. 

\begin{verse}
\itshape
It was a wild and windy day. The JumpStart ship was headed for Tree Fort Island. \\
Frankie was at the wheel. The sails flapped in the wind. The ship raced through the water. \\
Pierre asked why they were going so fast. CJ said that the wind was blowing them along on their adventure. He also asked if they know that wind is just air that is strong and fast. \\
Pierre said like Frankie. Pierre said that Frankie was strong and fast, too. \\
Pierre asked why the sky was getting so dark.\\
Eleanor said that she knew why it is dark. She explained that clouds get dark when they fill up with tiny drops of water.\\
Pierre said look! They are almost the same color as Eleanor's bow. \\
A big drop of rain fell on Pierre's nose. He was shocked. It is starting to rain. \\
CJ said that the rain is coming from the clouds. \\
The water in the clouds got too heavy, and now it is falling down on them. \\
Pierre said that it is just like when Hopsalot waters his garden. \\
\end{verse}
	
While modifying, there may be cases wherein a specific sentence or a line uttered by a character will be omitted or transformed into a declarative sentence not containing the original word/s. Such sentences can be interjections like ``Oh my!" and ``Alas!". These can be transformed as ``She was shocked" and ``He was concerned."

Aside from these, modifications such as removing contractions and periods (.) that do not actually mean the end of a sentence. With contractions, they were put back in their long form. For example, \textit{they'll} was transformed to \textit{they will}. This modification does not mean the tool used to extract the relations could not handle contractions. This just makes the results cleaner. It also disambiguates contractions from possessive nouns. For example, instances like \textit{Helen's} may mean ownership or just \textit{Helen is}. Removing nuances like this allows the tool to produce a more valid POS tagging and of course, extraction. 

As with the periods (.) like those found in titles (\textit{Mr.} and \textit{Dr.}), they were removed and the titles were transformed back into their long forms. For example, \textit{Mrs.} is transformed into \textit{Missus}. 

Lastly, story-specific modifications were done for the two \textit{Winnie the Pooh} stories. After careful examination, it was evident that the author was using non-existing English words in the dialogues of its characters. Words like \textit{suspicionated} and \textit{splendiferous} appeared in the story \textit{Everyone is special}. \textit{Tigger} is usually the character that uses such words due to his character trait. Such words were transformed to their actual English word counterparts. For example, \textit{suspicionated} and \textit{splendiferous} were transformed into \textit{suspected} and \textit{splendid}, respectively. This will make sure that all words are correctly tagged and the extracted relations contain valid concepts.

\subsection{Target Relations}
\label{sec:relations}

\begin{table}[H]   %t means place on top, replace with b if you want to place at the bottom
\centering
\caption{Target Relations} \vspace{0.25em}
\begin{tabular}{|p{3.5cm}|p{4cm}|p{5.5cm}|} \hline
\textbf{Element} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Example} \\ \hline
IsA					& Specifies what kind an entity is. & IsA(dog, pet) \\ \hline
PropertyOf			& Specifies an adjective to describe an entity. & PropertyOf(mango, yellow) \\ \hline
PartOf				& Specifies the \textit{parthood} of an entity in another entity. & PartOf(knob, door) \\ \hline
MadeOf				& Specifies a component of an entity. & MadeOf(door, wood) \\ \hline
CapableOf			& Specifies what an entity can do. & CapableOf(kid, jump) \\ \hline
OftenNear			& Specifies an entity near another entity in most instances. & OftenNear(chair, table) \\ \hline
LocationOf			& Specifies the location of an entity. & LocationOf(slide, play-ground) \\ \hline
EventForGoalEvent	& Represents an event that causes the fulfillment of a goal event. & EventForGoalEvent(go to playground, play football) \\ \hline
EventForGoalState	& Represents an event that causes the fulfillment of a goal state. & EventForGoalState(take a bath, be clean) \\ \hline
EffectOf			& Represents a cause-effect between two events. & EffectOf(skip breakfast, hungry) \\ \hline
EffectOfIsState		& Represents a cause-effect between an event and an end state. & EffectOfIsState(eat vegetables, health) \\ \hline
Happens				& Specifies the time an event/state happens. & Happens(breakfast, morning) \\ \hline
HasRole				& Specifies the role on a person in the story. & HasRole(Kisha, teacher) \\ \hline
RoleResponsibleFor	& Specifies an action done by a role. & RoleResponsibleFor(doctor, diagnose) \\ \hline
Owns				& Specifies the owner-ship of an object. & Owns(teacher, book) \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:targetrel}
\end{table}

For the purpose of this research, sixteen (16) relations were identified to be extracted. They were deemed to be related and helpful to the development of common sense knowledge for the children's story domain. Table \ref{tab:targetrel} contains the final list of target relations to be extracted in this study.

Based on their intended functions, these relations can be classified into different groups (See Table \ref{tab:classification}). 

\begin{table}[H]   %t means place on top, replace with b if you want to place at the bottom
\centering
\caption{Classification of Target Relations} \vspace{0.25em}
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{6.5cm}|} \hline
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Relations} \\ \hline
Things		& IsA, PropertyOf, PartOf, MadeOf, HasRole \\ \hline
Agents		& CapableOf, RoleResponsibleFor \\ \hline
Events		& EventForGoalEvent, EventForGoalState \\ \hline
Causal		& EffectOf, EffectOfIsState \\ \hline
Spatial		& LocationOf, OftenNear \\ \hline
Functional	& UsedFor \\ \hline
World		& Happens, Owns \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:classification}
\end{table}

The \textit{things} category can be used to describe the characters, objects, events and settings of the story. The \textit{agents} category specifies the intentional actions that can be done by the characters. \textit{Events} describe the temporal succession of events in terms of desire while \textit{causal} relations provide information on causality. \textit{Spatial} relations describe the location of objects and characters. \textit{Functional} describe the actions that can be done with an object. Lastly, \textit{world} relations provide a universal truth about characters, objects and events.

\subsection{Extraction Templates}
\label{sec:extractiontemplates}

Extraction templates refer to the different ways a certain relation is manifested in a sentence or a span of text. Since most of the relations to be extracted were adopted from ConceptNet, the initial decision was to just follow the templates they have been using to crowd-source data (see Section 3.4). However, due to the contrast of sentence complexity between ConceptNet sentence patterns and the sentences in the corpus, additional templates were added to address different instances. As for the additional relations like \textit{Happens}, the RST was followed.

\begin{table}[H]   %t means place on top, replace with b if you want to place at the bottom
\centering
\caption{Template Elements} \vspace{0.25em}
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{6.5cm}|} \hline
\textbf{Element} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
$<$NP$>$					& Noun Phrase \\ \hline
$<$NP:JobTitle$>$			& Noun Phrase indicating a Job Title \\ \hline
$<$Noun:Possessive$>$		& Possessive Noun \\ \hline
$<$AP$>$					& Adjective Phrase \\ \hline
$<$Pronoun:Possessive$>$	& Possessive Pronoun \\ \hline
$<$Verb$>$					& Verb in root form \\ \hline
$<$VP$>$					& Verb Phrase \\ \hline
$<$VP:Gerund$>$				& Gerund \\ \hline
$<$PP:Temporal$>$			& Temporal Prepositional Phrase \\ \hline
$<$Event$>$					& Event (usually a VP) \\ \hline
$<$GoalEvent$>$				& A desired event \\ \hline
$<$GoalState$>$				& A desired state \\ \hline
$<$Cause$>$					& Cause \\ \hline
$<$Effect$>$				& Event effect \\ \hline
$<$EffectState$>$			& State effect \\ \hline
$<$Indicator$>$				& Relation-specific Indicator \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:templateelements}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:templateelements} shows the different elements present in an extraction template. Nine (9) are tagged morphological information while the rest are custom tags created for this study. Lastly, \textit{indicators} ($<$Indicator$>$) are used to denote the presence of a relation in the sentence. This is similar to the transition words discussed in Section 3.1.2. These will be discussed in detail in Section  \ref{sec:indicators}.

Shown in Table \ref{tab:templates1} are the templates used for relations that can be extracted within a single sentence. While in Table \ref{tab:templates2}, shown are the templates used for relations that can be extracted within a sentence and across 2 sentences. Beside each template is a sample sentence. All templates are already the combination of ConceptNet sentence patterns and those manually derived from the corpus.

\subsection{Indicators}
\label{sec:indicators}

Indicators are transition words that aid in identifying explicit relations. In this study, 12 lists of indicators were created. Nine (9) are used in the templates above while the other 3 are used in the background. Table \ref{tab:indicators} shows the different types of indicators created.

\subsection{Architectural Design}
\label{sec:archidesign}

The architecture of the system is mostly dependent on the open-source tool GATE (See Section 3.5). The \textit{unstructured corpora} refers to the input children's stories. Each story must undergo the modifications mentioned in Section \ref{sec:modifications}. The components shown in Figure \ref{fig:archidesign} comprise the architectural design. Each must be included in a GATE Application Pipeline that will be run.

\begin{figure}[h]                %-- use [t] to place figure at top, [b] to place at the bottom
   \centering                    %-- use this to center the figure
   \includegraphics{archidesign1.jpg}      %-- include image file named as "sinag1.eps" 
   \caption{Architectural Design}
    \label{fig:archidesign}
\end{figure}

Each children's story text from the \textit{unstructured corpora} is opened in GATE by creating a Gate Document. Once the GATE documents are created, the next step is to create a GATE Corpus and add the documents. First, the GATE application resets the input of any previous annotations. This applies only if the input has already been annotated before passing through GATE. After cleaning, the input is parsed into tokens. The input was then  split into sentences and each token was annotated with their respective part-of-speech tags. After that, named-entities from the defined gazetteers were annotated. Then, pronouns are matched with the named-entities they are referring to in the text. 

Then, each token are processed to identify their lemmas, affixes and chunks. Lastly, the input text is ran through a transducer. This will finally identify all the target relations and create the appropriate annotations for each.

The output of the GATE tool is an annotated version of the story that also contain the extracted target relations.

\subsubsection{Resolving Story-specific Named Entities}
\label{sec:gazetteer}

In this implementation, a gazetteer resource was used to identify named entities in the input texts. However, the predefined lists does not cover some of the named entities in the children's story corpora. Such include characters, locations and roles. For example, in the \textit{Winnie the Pooh} set of stories, \textit{Pooh}, \textit{Piglet} and \textit{Tigger}, among others, are not included. Thus, additional lists are needed. Aside from the named entities found in stories, gazetteers are also created for indicators, world states and emotions, among others. These will be used by the transducer in its annotation patterns. A total of 20 new gazetteers were created for this study. Shown in Table \ref{tab:newgazetteersind} are the gazetteers created for indicators.

\begin{table}[H]   %t means place on top, replace with b if you want to place at the bottom

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:newgazetteersind}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:newgazetteersstory} shows the gazetteers created for the story characters, locations and objects. Others were added to assist in improving the extraction of target relations.

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:newgazetteersstory}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Recognizing Target Relations}
\label{sec:recogtarget}

In order to extract the target relations, a number of JAPE phases must be created to recognise and annotate them in the input texts. A total of 23 customized JAPE phases were created for this purpose. Shown in Table \ref{tab:newjaperel} are the new JAPE phases to recognize the target relations. Table \ref{tab:newjapemisc} shows the other JAPE phases that are usually prerequisites of the target relation JAPE phases.

\begin{table}[H]   %t means place on top, replace with b if you want to place at the bottom

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:newjapemisc}
\end{table}

\subsection{Post-Processing}
\label{sec:postprocessing}

After running the GATE tool to annotate the stories, all post-processing were done semi-automatically. Since the output of GATE is just the annotated version of the input corpus, the annotated stories were saved as XML from the GATE program. These XML files contain all annotations like \textit{Token} and \textit{Sentence}, among others.  The target relations were then extracted to a PBREL file. 

PBREL files are created for the purpose of this study. It contains all extracted target relations from a story. Aside from the relations and their corresponding concepts, the rules used to extract them are also included for debugging purposes. An excerpt from \textit{A wild weather day.pbrel} is shown below.

\begin{verse}
\itshape
UsedFor(snacks,eating) UsedForRelation3 \\
Owns(their,adventure) OwnsRelation3\\
Owns(Pierre,garden) OwnsRelation3\\
CapableOf(thunder,go) CapableOfRelation1\\
EffectOf(stopped blowing,stopped falling) EffectOf4\\
EffectOf(shook the clubhouse,looked out the window) EffectOf4\\
EffectOf(got really cold,turned into balls of ice) EffectOf4\\
\end{verse}

After creating PBREL files for each story, the extracted relations were then collated into a single CPBREL (Collated PBREL) file for each big group of stories (\emph{RAW} and \emph{MODIFIED}). Aside from collating, redundant relations were also removed. The final CPBREL files for the \emph{RAW} and \emph{MODIFIED} stories were used in the testing stage.
